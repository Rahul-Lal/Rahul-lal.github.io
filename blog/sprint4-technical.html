            Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

            Got blocked on a simple problem
            Solved a problem in an elegant way.
            In both cases:

            What was the problem?
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
            How did you feel throughout the process?
            What did you learn?
            
            Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
            Pseudocode
            Trying something
            Rubber ducky method
            Reading error messages
            Console.logging
            Googling
            Asking your peers for help
            Asking coaches for help
            Improving your process with reflection

          <h3>Sprint 4 - Technical</h3>
          <p>
              Starting fresh from the 'whereAreYou' function. The instructions emphasised on split and filter, <i>split</i> used to seperate each word in the string into an array of strings, filter used to eliminiate any mention of the word 'buzz'. Had a slight error due to mispelling split with spilt.<br><br>
              
              When completed the full method, FIRST ERROR: was outputting a object, not a string, this was solved by declaring a new variable that's been add new string values via array of spilted text.<br><br>

              Another problem that I all the word in the sentence is merged in a single words of a string. I solved that by adding space after each array value in the for loop. The downside to this is that the final answer has an extra space at the end of the sentence. So I use the slice method to remove it.<br><br>

              But for some apparent reason , it resorted to becoming it's original "buzzy" string. Turns out it had to do with the cases (the capitals), so far that I had to convert the inital string to a lowercase. This also lead to the error where a couple of characters that are upper case, that is where I was introduced to using the <i>Replace()</i> method, the all lowercased words to one that starts with the same word that starts woth an uppercase.<br><br>

              Okay something I got to confess, to produce the final outcome, I have to use the use a few more replace() methods to when the first replace method didn't do the job.<br><br>

              Why I chose to write about the <i>daBees'</i> method as oppose to <i>whereAreYou</i> method is that it had more clear transistion from problem to solution. I accomplished this by using JS functions such as <i>toLowerCase()</i>, <i>filter()</i>, <i>replace()</i> (mostly that), and <i>slice()</i>.<br><br><br><br>
