            <h3>As I'm talking to a Non-technical friend, I'll discuss:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</b><br>
                Think of a website as a person, a human being:<br><br>
                <i>HTML</i>: The physical being and the parts such as hands, feet, chest, head, hair (optional), eyes, nose, mouth, etc<br>
                <i>CSS</i>: How the being is presented such as eye color, hair color & style, size of hands & feet, skin color, their height, weight. So basically what they look like<br><br>
                
                <b>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</b><br>
                <i><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/contflow.htm" target="_blank">Control Flow</a></i> is the order how functions, variables & object declarations, and them being called are executed and evaluated in a running programming. Think of the order you follow a recipe on a cookbook<br>
                <i><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">Loops</a></i> are more a repetitive, where a function does a task/set of tasks for more than once, whether they know how many times or not. An example I can think of is when a school teacher grades a stack of their student's test, one by one.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</b><br>
                <i><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html" target="_blank">Document Object Model</a></i> or DOM is a programming <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=api&rlz=1C1CHBF_enNZ840NZ840&oq=api&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j0l2.2320j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">API</a> is designed to understand a HTML & XML file. Understand the structure of the elements and how it's accessed or manipulated.<br> An example I can think of is that features on Microsoft Excel how they convert the data on a spreadsheet into a visual graph like a pie or bar graph.<br><br>

                <b>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</b><br>
                A <i>function</i> is basically a series of tasks, like a recipe in a cook. The value it beings, is that it does a number of task within one tasks, killing as many birds with a singular stone.<br><br>

                <b>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</b><br>
                Accessing data from a <i>array</i> is like choosing from a range of options, like the options at a fast food outlet.<br>
                Accessing data from a <i>object</i> is like picking a aspect of the object, think remembering someone from the shirt they wear, or their name, or any small detail of a person they you found memorable.
