            Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?
            
            What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones?
            What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
            What are of you proud of from during this challenge?
            Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?
            How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?
            
            Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.
            What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
            Any moments of surprise or joy?
            If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

            Last practical on the last sprint, I had built and hosted a blog via <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. The instructions were really straight-forward and initutive, and there nothing simpler than that.<br><br>
            
            <b>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?</b><br>
            The biggest achivement for the learning competency was able to deploy and host a site. Still didn't use the timebox, due to adjustment to the agile methodlogy. <br><br>
