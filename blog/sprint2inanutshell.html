            Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

            <b>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</b><br>
            
            Last practical on the last sprint, I had built and hosted a blog via <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. The instructions were really straight-forward and initutive, and there nothing simpler than that.<br><br>
            
            <b>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?</b><br>
            The biggest achivement for the learning competency was able to deploy and host a site. Still didn't use the timebox, due to adjustment to the agile methodlogy. <br><br>
            

            <b>What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones?</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> - Offers tutorials for web development languages & projects<br><br>


            <b>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</b><br>
            I had no trouble with the practical of the sprint, but writing the relection pieces i had a lot of thought of what to write down.<br><br>

            <b>What are of you proud of from during this challenge?</b><br>
            The end product - a functioning website<br><br>

            <b>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</b><br>
            No<br><br>

            <b>How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?</b><br>
            At least half the speed than it took previously<br><br>

            <b>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</b><br>

            <b>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</b><br>
            <br>An I issue I had when making the site is trying to build a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp" target="_blank"></a>stick navbar</a>.  The end result was actually the getElementByID method gets the method from the class tag than the id tag of an HTML element.<br>

            <b>Any moments of surprise or joy?</b><br>
            There were great moments the brought me in a positive way, none I can think of that brought surprise or joy.<br><br>

            <b>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</b><br>
            <b>HTML</b> - I would say a <i>cat</i> as they are everywhere - at home, work, the internet, and the logo of GitHub<br>
            <b>CSS</b> - I would say a <i>chameleon</i> as mainly for their apperances
