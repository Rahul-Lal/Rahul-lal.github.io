            # Code Readability Primer
                ### What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?
                ### Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.
            # Code Readability Challenge
                ### As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?
                ### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
                ### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?
            # Testing

                ```
                function testSum(){
                    var expected = 7
                    var actual = sum(5, 2)

                    if (actual != expected) {
                        console.log("It's broken..")
                    } else {
                        console.log("It works!")
                    }
                }
                ```
                Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:
                ### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?
                ### How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?
                ### Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?
            # Repl.it - Code in your browser
                ### What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?
                ### How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
                ### When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?
            # Problem Solving and Pseudocode
                ### Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?
                ### How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?
            # JavaScript Variables and Object Types
                ### How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?
                ### Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?
            # Manipulating JavaScript Objects
                ### What was the highlight of this kata for you?
                ### Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?
            # FizzBuzz (Super Edition)
                ### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
                ### How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?
            # JavaScript Gradebook
                ### What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?
                ### Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?
            # Built-in Methods
                ### On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata?
