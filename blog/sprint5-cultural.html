                <b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b><br>
                The number one I learned was how to convert my abstract thoughts into print (AKA these blog post). The second thing is about my mindfulness, and there is a lot of thoughts, mostly about the programme and beyond that (ideal job after EDA). The third thing is something had some thought about is my values<br><br>
                <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b><br>
                My awareness of my mindfulness<br><br>
                <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b><br>
                Understand how to work in a agile enviroment.<br><br>
                <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b><br>
                Like myself whose has technical experience, who need to work on the people side of the job. Also, for anyone new to the tech industry, the core parts of the programme could help manage ourselves from the toll the job takes on one's self.<br><br>
                <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</b><br>
                No, as someone whose people skills is not feasible enough for the industry, it's a must I do the core stuff, also I still want code stuff because it's still on my mind.<br><br>
