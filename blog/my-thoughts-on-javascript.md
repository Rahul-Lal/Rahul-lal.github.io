# My thoughts on Javascript

My thoughts on Javscript (JS) in a few words, a work in progress. This have both a good meaning and a bad one. 

The good meaning mostly comes from experience of picking up a good portion of the language, this comes from have prior understanding in programming, with languages C# and Java. I'm happy to see there is "programming language" that is used for the web.
