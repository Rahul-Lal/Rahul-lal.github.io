      So I had done some blogs and videos of my time during sprint one... and they suck!<br><br>So I'm gonna start over with a fresh start, cover topic to topic.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Command Line</h3>   
  <p>  
    <!--
        Can you think of an analogy for it?
        Did you stick to the timebox guidelines?
        If not, what change would you make next time?
        Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
        Did you learn anything unexpected?
    -->

    <br><br>
    The first topic we cover right now is source control, specifically Git & Github. I already had a good practical understanding of Github.
    <br><br>
    Git, on the other hand, I used once. So the opportunity arisen that I forge my understanding with Git starting with this sprint.
    <br><br>
    Along with Git, I also learned using command line using Command Prompt, which is from my understanding operating a computer with a set of commands as oppose to using buttons and multimedia content through a graphical using interface (GUI). A analogy I can think of about command line is changing channels of a television, but using the buttons of the physical device instead of the remote.
    <br><br>
    Here some examples of some Git Commands:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>cd [Insert Folder Name]</b> – Selecting & Inserting a folder**</li>
      <li> <b>git clone [URL for git file].git</b> – Cloning a existing repository</li>
      <li> <b>touch [Insert File Name]</b>– Creating a new file*</li>
      <li> <b>git add -A</b> – Staging files to be commited into the remote repository</li>
      <li> <b>git branch [Name of Branch]</b> – Creating new repository branch</li>
  </ul>
</p>

    <p>
      Another thing EDA have is what is called a timebox, which is a rough schedule about how much time on each part of the topic (Observing, doing, extra study, reflection). I did not use exactly the time needed for each part. I’m considering combining the seeing and doing together by doing the tutorial while watching. Another thing I should do is develop my reflection on the topic incrementally, as I take note when it’s the first thing in mind.
      Lastly, I didn't learn anything that's considered unexpected.

      <br><br>* File is an individual item
      <br>** Folder is a container for files 
    </p>

    <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
    <p>
    <!--
      Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
      Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
      Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
      Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
    -->

    <b>Git</b> - A version control program that designed to track handle projects by tracking changes and collaboratiom for teams<br>
    <b>GitHub</b> - A web-based tool that hosts files remotely for version control tools such as Git<br><br>

    An analogy I can think of is that a Git being a physical file the holds papers & pictures, and GitHub being an file room that's out of your base of operations.<br><br>

    <i>Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</i><br>
    Chances are, I may not remember everything from last week, but I should at least have the main idea of what was covered.<br><br>

    <i>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</i><br>
    I still don't stick to the timebox, as still need time to understand the concept of what's covered, and fixes in the code of the tutorials.

  </p>
    <h3>Install and Explore Git</h3>
    <p>
    <!--
      What is a GitHub work flow?
      What did you notice about your own learning?
      What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
      Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
    -->

    <b>What is a GitHub work flow?</b><br>
    The Github work flow or the <i>GitHub Flow</i> is a workflow that manage different branches of a repository 

    What I noticed about my own learning is that I found easier to know what is my objective is, and  use what I can to accomphish this objective. Following a set (extact t the word) instructions I found extremely restricting mentally and creatively.,<BR><BR>

    The instruction in found confusing at first but steadily understanding the format. This could due understanding to work under the agile methodoglogy.<br><br>

    The thing I would do differently is seperate time to do all primers/reflections and all practical tutorial.
  </p>
    <h3>Track and Commit</h3>
    <p>
    <b>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</b><br>
     Think of staging as putting a written into a envolope, and commiting as sending the envoloped letter into the post box to be sent to the address of the sendee. 

  </p>
    <h3>Branch, Pull, Merge</h3>
    <p>
    <b>What is Master?</b><br>
    The Master branch is the main branch of a repository and the root of alternate branches<br><br>
    
    <b>Why create a Branch?</b><br>
    In a situation where want create and test a feature that's not included in the main repository. Branching allows to create a secondary repository, which derives from the last commit made before the branching proccess.<br><br>

    <b>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</b><br>
    The concepts that's been covered feel intuitive because of having prior knowledge and understanding ideas that precuse the concepts covered.

  </p>
    <h3>GitHub Fork & Clone</h3>
    <p>
    <b>What are some examples of when you would fork?</b><br>
    An example I can think of is when you want to create you own version of a project, and don't want the source code of your project be commited on the repository of the project it's based on<br><br>
    
    <b>Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.</b><br>
    Forking:
    <ol>
      <li>Login into GitHub</li>
      <li>Find desired repository through the author's profile or use search engine</li>
      <li>Once found, press the Fork button on the top right-hand corner of the window</li>      
      <li>Select the location where you want the forked repository located</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cloning:
    <ol>
        <li>Open the desired repository</li>
        <li>On the middle right hand corner, press the green button 'Clone or download'</li>
        <li>Press the button next to the repository's link</li>
        <li>Close the window & open Git Bash on your computer</li>
        <li>Direct yourself the intended directory</li>
        <li> Enter 'git clone <i>Enter repository link</i>.git', then press Enter</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
  <p>
    <b>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</b><br>
    I didn't have a moment when during these sprints so far, that everything just 'clicked'. But I'd a 'clicked' moments when doing a project outside the sprints.
  </p>

    <h3>Setup Repo & Create Blog</h3>
    <p>
    I was suprised by the simplicity of setting up this domain. I had built this site initally on a different repository (which I regretably deleted), using the domain <i>username.github.io/repositoryname</i>. The reason I'd change repositories is because of the current one has a more cleaner domain. The difference between between the two I can think of is the licences. The first using the Apache, the latest/current one using MIT. I plan to use further knowledges from the sprint using this site as an exemplar of work the enhance my understanding, including the blogs.<br><br>
  
    Speaking about blogs, I thought I'll be using specialised tool that sets up an CMS, pages, files, links between them, etc. But in-fact the "hard way" turns out to be the easier one after all. All the blog stuff is all nested in a blog folder, except for the CSS (it's in the css folder).

    <h3>Thinking like a programmer</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Describe the process for solving problems</b><br>
        
        According to a <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/think-like-a-programmer/" target="_blank">blog</a> on the site <i>Zapier</i>, their problem solving process for programmers follow these two steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Find the answer independently</li>
          <li>Ask a community a more seasoned individuals</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://codeburst.io/10-steps-to-solving-a-programming-problem-8a32d1e96d74" target="_blank">Another blog</a> from Codeburst has 10 steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Read the problem at least three times</li>
          <li>Manually work through the problem with at least three sets of sample data</li>
          <li>Simplify & optimize the solution</li>
          <li>Write solution in pseudocode (dummy code)</li>
          <li>Convert pseudocode into actual code of choice and debug it</li>
          <li>Simplify & optimize the code of the solution</li>
          <li>Debug the issues with solution</li>
          <li>Write comments, really useful ones</li>
          <li>Get feedback by reviewing code from someone else</li>
          <li>Practice makes perfect</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Will you follow that process? How?</b><br>
        I will more likely follow the ten step process from Codeburst, as it more robust process which allows me to solve the problem almost independently.<br><br>
         
        <b>What did you learn about flipped classroom?</b><br>
        <a href="http://elearning.tki.org.nz/Teaching/Future-focused-learning/Flipped-learning" target="_blank">Flipped classrooms</a> are when the student learns the content <i>prior</i> to consulting a teacher. I think it's beneficial because:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Self-pace learning</li>
          <li>Learning with your perferred format (visual, audio, kinesthetic, etc)</li>
          <li>Cover the basic stuff, then consult teacher for the parts you find difficult</li>
          <li>Access resource outside of the classroom</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <br><br>
    <h3>End of sprint reflection</h3>
    <p>
    <b>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</b><br>
    I consider my first sprint/week as a adjustment period, 

    <b>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</b><br>
