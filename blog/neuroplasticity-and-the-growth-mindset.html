    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b><br>
        Using the principles that's listed the <a href="https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/" target="_blank">linked post</a>, I'll explain each of the ten principle.<br><br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Use it or lose it</b> - Your knowledge and ability is at it's best when it's keep being in use. If delayed will be eventually lost, if can be regained and constant (ideally) practice and use</li>
            <li><b>Use it and improve it</b> - Building on the first principle, your knowledge and ability is also at best when it's in use. Also, what you know serves as a foundation to learn further knowledge and skill in which betters the two </li>
            <li><b>Specificity</b> - How you learn the desired skill or knowledge not only forges those specific areas, it also forges a different way of thinking</li>
            <li><b>Repetition matters</b> - You heard the saying <i>practice makes perfect</i>, or a more refined version of the saying <i><a href="https://www.learnmindpower.com/practice-makes-permanent/" target="_blank">practice makes permanent</a></i>. Again bulding on the first principle that knowledge/ability being at it's best via continuous use, do a certain numbers of times to be ingrained in you, keep doing it to keep it still ingrained</li>
            <li><b>Intensity matters</b> - Like lifting weights at the gym, you make progress by lifting more than you can, but not too much that you can injure yourself</li>
            <li><b>Time matters</b> - You heard the saying that <i>time is the best medicine</i>, it also applies to bettering youself. Unless you have a eidetic memory, it take time to make progress</li>
            <li><b>Salience matters</b> - What's your 'why' for learning the suppose knowledge/skill, a reason is your driving force to what your doing and keeps your from falling off the wagon</li>
            <li><b>Age matters</b> - Like a young body that's somewhat at it's prime, so is the mind. It's ideal to learn/teached something at a younger age, as they apply it without the difficulty of old age</li>
            <li><b>Transference</b> - What you learned can potentially be the building blocks to learn new skills</li>
            <li><b>Interference</b> - When developing the knowledge/skill, bad habits can get in the way of it. A good example of this is when you arrange time to learn a new programming language, but you wasted that time scroll Facebook</li>
        </ol>        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>How one might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for their own benefit</b>
        <ol>
                <li><b>Use it or lose it</b> - Spend rough a good portion of time to revise what you know, practically and theoretically</li>
                <li><b>Use it and improve it</b> - After spending some time revising what you know, but something that builds on your current knowledge</li>
                <li><b>Specificity</b> - Do further research on the topic and find something that you can easily understand</li>
                <li><b>Repetition matters</b> - Set a fixed time of the day, or a fixed time on set days to do the learning</li>
                <li><b>Intensity matters</b> - Find challenges or tasks that would apply the stuff you learned to solve a problem</li>
                <li><b>Time matters</b> - Decide on how long would it take to completely learn the stuff and completely understand it</li>
                <li><b>Salience matters</b> - Explore and write down why you want to learn the knowledge/skill</li>
                <li><b>Age matters</b> - Start learning as early as possible</li>
                <li><b>Transference</b> - Keep you mind to explore new knowledge/skills where you can see use what you know as prior knowledge</li>
                <li><b>Interference</b> - How to AVOID interference is by find something, somewhere, that will help you focus on the work at hand</li>
            </ol><br><br>        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</b><br>
        From doing the sprints so far, here's what I suggest:<br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Specificity</b> - I find it intutive to build personal projects that expand you understand the contents being learned</li>
            <li><b>Time</b> - Try to get a much work I can get done by smaller time windows, via pomodoro technique</li>
            <li><b>Repetition</b> - If you have difficulty understanding/remembering something, find an opportunity to do that task as repetitive as possible</li>
            <li><b>Improvement</b> - The same about building personal projects for expand on understanding, but also for improvement in skills</li>
            <li><b>Interference</b> - One fundamental thing I do to AVOID interference, is I work at the campus instead of work from home, </li>
            <li><b>Use it of Lost it</b> - The fundamental reason that I suggest building personal projects is to your skill/knowledge at what's currently it's peak </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b><br>
        From the last sprint, I used the <i>Watch And Code</i> tutorial for Javascript. What I like about it so far is that I'm builing something with the learned skill, in this case is a To-Do List. The downside is course that consists of a series of video as oppose to a more interactive interface, which mean fewer windows on my screen.<br><br>

    <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b><br>
        A mindset of <i>growth</i> is one continuously envolving like a infant growing into adult. It's important because this allows people to continously improve themselves through: learning more, training more, study more, etc.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b><br>
        No.<br><br>        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b><br>
        Using personal projects to maintain and expand my learning.<br><br>        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b><br>
        For this topic of growth mindset, I remember watching the video about <i>The Mindset You Need To Succeed</i> a few years back. What I liked about it explains growth mindset as well as the polar opposite <i>fixed mindset</i>.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</b><br>
        These understandings will remind me that if a failure occurs, it's not a failure for life, but a learning curve to next time this almost happens.<br><br>
