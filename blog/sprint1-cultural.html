                Hi Everyone
                
                My name is Rahul Lal and I'm one of the foundations student here at EDA. I'm a fijian-indian whose born & raised in Auckland, specifically in Pakuranga, which doesn't feel that far. I came to EDA is to return to pursuing a career in programming, I had studied the field through diploma courses in Auckland CBD.
                
                My two values I can think of:
                * Self Improvment - I'm not perfect, either is everyone else. But this is important as this the opportunity to strive towards become our perfect version of ourselves. Using what we know as a foundation towards much more.
                * Uniqueness - Taking advantage of what makes each one of us different from everyone else.
                </p>
