		<h2>Add Stuff Please! :)</h2>
		<p>
			As the drum roll started on that day
			Heard a hundred miles away
			A million shells were fired
			And the green fields turned to grey
			The bombardment lasted all day long
			Yet the forts were standing strong
			Heavily defended
			Now the trap's been sprung and the battle has begun
			Descend into darkness
			303 days below the sun
			<br><br>
			Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one under the gun
			Thy will be done (thy will be done), and the judgement has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one, fields of Verdun
			<br><br>
			Though a million shells have scarred the land
			No one has the upper hand
			From the ground above to trenches
			Where the soldiers make their stand
			As the trenches slowly turn to mud
			And then quickly start to flood
			Death awaits in every corner
			As they die in the mud, fill the trenches with blood
			Descend into darkness
			303 days below the sun
			<br><br>
			Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one under the gun
			Thy will be done (thy will be done), and the judgement has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one, fields of Verdun
			<br><br>
			Fields of execution turned to wasteland from the grass
			Thou shalt go no further it was said, "They shall not pass!"
			The spirit of resistance and the madness of the war
			So go ahead, face the lead, join the dead
			Though you die where you lie, never asking why
			<br><br>
			Descend into darkness
			303 days below the sun
			Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one under the gun
			Thy will be done (thy will be done), and the judgement has begun
			Nowhere to run, father and son
			Fall one by one, fields of Verdun
